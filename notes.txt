# Idea is to first read an image
# After reading the image, we want to make sure it is a square
# We then want to break the square image it into grid sections 
# The grid sections can then be averaged/moded/etc to find the most important color
# These newly calculated values will fill the n x n matrix
# Lego pieces with closest color value will fill the n x n matrix
# Output the result


Some caveats - 
I want to use only the most common 1x1 plates sold to minimize cost; This restricts the colors I can use
This means I will use the following colors (from bricklink: https://www.bricklink.com/catalogColors.asp)
